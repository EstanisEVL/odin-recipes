In this project, I will build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

This project is just to build my HTML chops.

Skills demonstrated once completed the project:
- elements and tags
- boilerplate
- texts
- lists
- links and images
- commit messages
